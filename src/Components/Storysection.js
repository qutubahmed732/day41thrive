                            Every morning feels like fighting fires. Your phone never stops buzzing with crew questions, customer complaints, and vendor issues. You're making every decision, fixing every mistake, and wondering why your "successful" business feels like a 60-hour prison sentence.

                            <strong>Here's what's really happening:</strong> You've outgrown "winging it" - but you haven't built the systems to replace yourself. Your team waits for your approval. Your processes live in your head. Your growth is capped by how many balls YOU can juggle.
